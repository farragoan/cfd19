# diafaneocracy - Transparent, secure voting systems, powered by Azure blockchain

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Elections, referenda, and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy.
Build a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate how you can make these processes more secure, reliable, and transparent using Azure Blockchain.

# INTRODUCTION

The main issue with a realistic scalable blockchain system is to have scalability at reduced cost. Currently, India is the world's largest democracy and as such, any solution should have target capability of being able to conduct an election of 1.2 billion people without compromising on transparency and immutability, or becoming cost-ineffective for these countries.

diafanocracy relies on leveraging existing infrastructure and its own sidechains to use the available computing power efficiently while also increasing the number of nodes in the network. 

# HOW IT WORKS

1. The area to be surveyed is already divided into political constituencies. Local schools or computer-heavy organisations in these constituencies will serve as polling booths.
